# DoList

Greetings from Sam Pool, developer of DoList. DoList is a simple full-stack web app which allows users to create ToDo lists sorted into categories.

## Background

I wanted to make this app for my own use. I use Apple notes to keep track of my grocery / shopping lists, but wanted to be able to keep different to-do items stored in collapsible categories, and easily see which items are checked in each category without having to scroll the entire list (My current grocery list has 100+ items).

I am also using this concept as an opportunity to grow my familiarity with TypeScript and MongoDB. 

## Primary Tech

DoList uses the **MERN-stack** with TypeScript.

More specifically, here is the primary tech for each layer:
